		http://www.yoursite.com/wp-content/plugins/

		e.g:
		http://www.yoursite.com/wp-content/plugins/rave-player/

	- Upload the contents of this package to the newly created folder.

3. Activate the plugin
	- Log in to your WordPress Admin Section and click the "Plugins" tab on the right.

4. Create a new player
	- The Rave Player menu should appear in the left-hand side bar toward the bottom.
	- Click "Players" and create a new player.
	- Underneath the preview player you'll see a "short code, which should look like:
		[rave]
	- Copy and paste [rave] into your page or post

5. Set up a widget:
	- Click "Appearance" from the admin menu, then "Widgets"
	- Find "Rave Player" and drag it into a widget area.
	- Select the player you wish to appear in the sidebar.

6. To use the "link" option (ecommerce, or have playlist items link out to another page)
	- In your Wordpress "media" section, select a media file and enter a URL to the external page in the "description" field. If the description field is a URL, Rave will use that URL for the "link" when rendering a playlist.
